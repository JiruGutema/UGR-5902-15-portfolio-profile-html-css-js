              <h3>eCommerce</h3>
              <p>
                I developed a fully functional eCommerce website for clothing
                commerce using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB,
                Express.js, React, and Node.js. This platform allows users to
                seamlessly browse a wide range of clothing items, add them to
                their cart, and complete their purchases with a secure payment
                system. The user-friendly interface, built with HTML and CSS,
                provides an engaging shopping experience, showcasing products in
                an organized and visually appealing manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensures
                efficient handling of user requests and data management. MongoDB
                serves as the database, storing product information, user
                profiles, and transaction details. This project highlights my
                ability to integrate various technologies to create a robust and
                scalable eCommerce solution, demonstrating my skills in both
                front-end and back-end development.

              <h3>File Encryption Software</h3>
              <p>
                This File Encryption Software uses cryptography to securely
                encrypt and decrypt files. By employing robust encryption
                algorithms, the software ensures the confidentiality and
                integrity of sensitive information. The encrypted files can only
                be unlocked using a secure key, making it an ideal solution for
                protecting personal or business data.

                I developed a file-sharing application that enables users to
                effortlessly share files over a local network. The app is
                designed to facilitate quick and secure file transfers between
                devices, making it ideal for both personal and professional use.
                With an intuitive user interface, users can easily select and
                send files, ensuring a seamless experience without the need for
                complicated setups or external servers.

                sourcing. The site features a visually appealing layout with
                vibrant imagery and informative sections that detail the various
                coffee varieties, sourcing regions, and the import/export
                process. Users can easily navigate through the portfolio to

                While it does not include a backend, the focus on front-end

              <p>
                I am currently exploring the concept of developing an encryption
                system influenced by ransomware methodologies. The goal is to
                create a robust security framework that enables users to
                securely encrypt their sensitive data while also learning from
                the vulnerabilities exposed by ransomware attacks. By
                implementing advanced encryption algorithms and utilizing secure
                key management practices, this system aims to provide users with
                peace of mind when storing and sharing confidential information.
